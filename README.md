FractalCanvas
=============

HTML5/JS factal explorer 

Simple fractal explorer I wrote a while ago because I was interested in how fractals are rendered. I would recommend to not use javascript for this kind of calculation on larger scale. The script is pretty heavy and it takes a while to process. I chose javascript because it was easy to get results (and show it to other people! :D).

Basically renders a mandlebrot set on (small) canvas and allows you to zoom by clicking.
